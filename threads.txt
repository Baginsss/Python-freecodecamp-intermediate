Threads: An entity within a process that can be scheduled (also known as "lightweight process")
A process can spawn multiple threads.

+ All threads within a process share the memory
+ lightweight
+Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
+ Great for I/0-bound takss

- Threading is limited by GIL: Only one thread at a time
- No effect for CPU-bound tasks 
- Not interreptable/killable
- Careful with race conditions
